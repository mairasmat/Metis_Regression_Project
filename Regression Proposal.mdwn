# Regression Project Proposal
### Question/need:
- What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
The purpose of this model will be to analyze data such as box office revenue, budget, rating, etc. of movies that are part of franchises.
- Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
Movie producers, when deciding whether to continue an existing franchise in some capacity.
### Data Description:
- What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
(https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchises/sort/World)
(https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchise/?ref_=bo_lnav_hm_shrt)
(https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genre/sg3353276673/?ref_=bo_gs_table_26)
- What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
- If modeling, what will you predict as your target?
The model itself will take data from all genres of movie, but I'm particularly interested in using it to predict how future reboots and possible sequels of horror movies will fare in the market. (If that doesn't work out, I could also just apply it generally to possible sequels/reboots of any genre.)
### Tools:
- How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
- Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
### MVP Goal:
- What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
